        <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">1. What is DOM and what is the purpose of DOM?</h1>

        <p>DOM is Document Object Model. It can change the website interface as like as we want.
            The purpose of DOM is that DOM helps us to create our website more dynamic and interactive using styles and
            other attributes.</p>



            <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">2. How will you select HTML elements using DOM? Name the DOM methods</h1>

            <p>It's depending on us what we want to do. For example: <br>

                If we want to get a specific ID we can use <b>'document. getElementById():'</b>  <br>
                
                To get all elements with a specific tag name we can use <b>'document. getElementsByTagName();'</b> <br>
                
                If we want to get all elements with a specific class Name we can use <b>'document.getElementsByClassName ():'</b> <br>
                
                if we want to get the first element that matches the CSS selector we can use <b>'document.querySelector();'</b> <br>
                
                On the other hand, If we want to get all elements that match the CSS selector we can use <b>'document.querySelectorAll();'</b></p>



                <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">3. What is event bubble?</h1>
                <p>Event bubble will select the target elements. This event first selects the target element,  and then it's go to the parent element,  and it will continue until it reaches the top level of document objects</p>



                <h1 class="text-5xl font-bold">4. What is a callback function and why will you use it?</h1>

                <p>A callback function is a function that helps us to re-use many times.  The callback function is usually passed as an argument to another function. We can use this function where we want. If we use callback function we don't need to re-use same function inside different area. We can just call this function then it will work. For example : const reactangle = Reactangle ();</p>
